# Java-Music-Player

### Objective

The goal of this project is to use Java 17 and NetBeans to make a local music player. Right now it does a total random shuffle on the files, so some will repeat, but it is still a random order. The GUI is built with java.swing imports, and utalizes the NetBeans builder.

### Needed Files

Link to the Google Drive Folder for the .wav files used for the music.
